   <h1>Reflections</h1><br>
    <h2>Here is my take on the DBA/DBC experience</h2>

    DBC and EDA seem to be taking a unique approach to teaching the required skills to become an industry ready web developer, in a short amount of time. According to the video they're achieving this in a number of different ways:
    <br>
    1. Quality instruction by experienced programmers
    2. Removing negative stereotypes which could also became learning barriers
    3. Encouraging students to take responsibility and control of their own success
    4. Helping students to develop good communication skills 
    <br>
    A reasonable portion of the chat is spent highlighting the importance of maintaining a positive attitude in all areas of your study.  Self-doubt and negativity, not only about yourself but toward others, doesn’t actually provide any value or benefit toward achieving your overall goals. Realising this early and remaining mindful of it throughout your time at the academy is essential.
    
    This advice is then reinforced by several examples of how previous students have unintentionally sabotaged themselves. One of the examples was that sometimes the process of learning to code often comes with preconceived ideas about who is or who isn’t capable of learning it. I think by dispelling some of these myths helps to inspire confidence in prospective students by providing them with rational explanations as to why they're inaccurate.  Sharif also stresses that successful results are primarily attributed to personal work ethic.  Even though there are set hours (9-6) that must be maintained, it is not uncommon for students to stay longer in order to complete or achieve the necessary outcomes.  He also points out that given the time frame laid out to complete the course and the cost (and often the personal sacrifices), then it’s certainly worth going above what is suggested.  
    What are my impressions?
    
    I think it would be fair to summarise that this style of learning to code (Bootcamp) is a considerable variation from the traditional approach and still in its infancy.  In order to achieve their desired goals, DBC and EDA have had to and continue to develop innovative new ways to teach their curriculum.  In doing so, they seem to have identified some of the more mundane traits within the coding culture and improved on them.  For me, perhaps the overall message is that even though DBC/EDA has endevoured to create a unique learning environment, geared toward providing students with the best possible chance of success, ultimately your final results will depend on your own efforts and personal commitment.
    
   <h2>How do I see myself engaging with this culture?</h2>
    <br>
    There are certain aspects of the bootcamp culture that already align with how I currently work, so I don't expect too many issues. In saying that, the biggest difference is that is that I have worked independently for about 3 years now, and so working in a team may take some adjustments.  I’m certainly not opposed to the concept, just stating the most obvious difference.  
    <br>
   <h2>Have my expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <br>
    No. Prior to applying I had researched the academy and their program and believe I had a reason understanding of what they were offering.
    <Br>
   <h2>Am I excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make me nervous?</h2>
   <br>
   Yes, I am certainly looking forward to it.  There’s nothing too daunting about it that makes me feel nervous at all just yet, but this may change closer to the bootcamp and as I get further into the study.
