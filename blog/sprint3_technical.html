                  <p><strong>The differences between HTML and CSS</strong></p>
                  <p>HTML is an acronym for 'Hypertext Markup Language'.  It is used to create the basic framework and content of the page, such as the written text, tables, lists etc. HTML is the foundation language of the internetand.</p>
                  <p>CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) is enables designers/developers to control the style of the website. Layout, visual effects, background and color are all aspects which can be controlled with the use of CSS.</p>

                  <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong></p>
                  <p>Flow control is the term used when refering to the process and order by which a particular program or written code executes and carries out its directives. Loops are part of a code that is executed repeatedly for a variety of situations, untill a desired outcome is reached.</p>
                  <p>A real life everyday example of something that is comparable to control flow and loops would be when when my alarm goes off first thing everymorning.  Immediately my internal code asks, do I push snooze and sleep another 10 mins or do I press stop?  The answer is press snooze. This process caries out another 2 times until eventually I decide that I need to get up and so I eventually press stop.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</strong></p>
                  <p>The DOM is an acronym for 'Document Object Model'. Basically, it is a term used to refer to and describe the objects (or elements) within the tree like structure of a webpage.  Javascript can access and influence these objects, allowing us to add, remove and change the state of these elements.</p>
                  <p>An example of interacting with the DOM would be when we change the colour of the text in the H1 tag or animating an image node from one side of the document to the other.</p>

                  <p><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong><p>
                  <p>An array is simply just a list.  The point of an arrays is that you can use them to store multiple items of the same kind. An example of an array is the list of items in a todo list (like in the watch and code tutorial). An object is something that has or is made up of a list of properties (sometimes with values) which can be access as a whole or indiviually.</p>
                  <p>The difference between accessing data from an array as opposed to an object (in my experiece this far) is that data from an array is generally accessed to be manipulated, whereas data from an obect helps you to do the manipulating?  I'm not sure how accurate this is.</p>

                  <p><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong></p>
                  <p>A function is a piece of code that carries out an instruction or task.  When created within a program, they can be accessed at various stages to perform a particular role in order to complete what is being done.  So, a function is the equivalent to an individual team member in a team made up of many team members, all with a different task to perform in order to complete the overall task</p>
