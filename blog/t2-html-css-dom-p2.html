                    <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
                    <p>Responsive web pages provide a better user experience for their audience.  This is mainly due to the fact that a site will perform both functionally and visually correct, regardless of the viewing platform and generally equates to the site being used to its full potential.</p>

                    <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
                    <p>My guess is that 'semantic structure' refers to the way in which code is written in a specific format and order, particularly so that it is legible and follows the basic rules of good practice, allowing others to easily interpret it.</p>
