                  <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Activity</h2>
                  <p><em>12 November 2010</em></p>
                  <h3>Gather Evidence</h3>
                  
                  <p>(1) Gather evidence to identify what your personal values are. The reflection gets you to examine and identify who you are at this point, this involves a self-evaluation and seeking feedback from two or three trusted friends, family, whanau, colleagues. This allows you to compare how you see yourself, with how others see you.
                     Evidence might include: stories of how these values were demonstrated in practice; a testimonial/feedback from someone; an achievement you are proud of; using a tool to help you surface and name the values most important to you; visuals or narratives that help you describe where your values came from; whakatauki or quotes that sum up your values;
                     your review of learning</p>

                  <p>(2) Gather evidence to identify your strengths and areas for development. Evidence might include: personality or skills/capability assessment tools like Myers Briggs, Strengthsfinder; DOPE; Capability Sort; Minded; task 1 examples.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h3>Document it</h3>
                  <p>Next sprint, you will publish this document as a blog post which will be visible to your cohort and facilitator. Your blog participation counts towards your overall assessment. Until then, write your findings on a temporary document (word, google docs, text edit etc).</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>(1) Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</strong></p>
                  
                  <p class="answers">Self assessment and self reflection is not an easy task to carry out, but it is probably something we should all do on a regular basis.  If I were to chose 3 qualities that I believe are the foundation of my core personal values they would be <u>honesty, integrity and loyalty</u>.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</strong></p>
                  
                  <p class="answers">When I was 14 I found a handbag in a shopping trolley in the car park of Pack'n'Save in Christchurch about 2 days before christmas.  I opened it up and the first thing I noticed was a substantial roll of money in it. To be honest, I was remember I was quite shocked because I don't think I'd probably seen that amount of cash before.
                  I took it back to the car where my mother was waiting and showed her.  From there, we took it to the Pack'n'Save counter and handed it in.  They took my name and number and we went home.</p>
                  
                  <p class="answers">A few hours later we got a call from the woman who had lost it thanking us for handing it in.  This was in the days before eftpos and she told us she had just been to the bank drawn the money out and was off to buy presents and so you can imagine how greatful she was.</p>

                  <p class="answers">Although there was never any thought of keeping the money, I have always remembered the story because I have hoped that if it was ever me that lost the money, someone out there would do the right thing by handing it in to.</p>

                  <p><strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong></p>
                  
                  <p class="answers">Being Māori is something that has always given me an immense sense of pride. I believe this pride is a direct result of the influence my grandparents had on me, who grew up in an era where Māoritanga, or being Māori, wasn't as celebrated as what it seems to be today.
                  
                  <p class="answers">I suspect it was probably their own persoanl experiences with the early negative attitude towards their culture that motivated them to ensure all of their grandchildren (not just myself), were well versed in who our iwi are, where we are from and why it is important to remember these things.
                  The outcome of these lessons provided me with a good foundation to go out and experience the world with confidence and a fearless, uncomprimising attitude toward being judged for being Maori.</p>

                  <p class="answers">I have travelled extensively in the last 20 years, spending 12 of them outside of New Zealand.  The assurance of knowing that whatever happens, whatever defeats or difficulties that I encounter on my journeys, I can always return home to my turangawaewae, provided me with a sense of security.</p>

                  <p><strong>(2) Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</strong></p>

                  <p class="answers">I took the test at <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality">16personalities.com</a> and was quite shocked by the result.  Shocked in that it seems to be a reasonably accurate assessment.</p>
                  <p class="answers">The result was that I am the 'DEBATER PERSONALITY (ENTP, -A/-T)'. The following are lists are a Debaters strengths an weaknesses</p>

                  <p class="answers">To cut a long story short, it seems as though my assessment is saying, "Your attributes are awesome and you're just what we're looking for, but unfortunately you're not a team player, so..."</p>

                  <p><strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</strong>
                  <p class="answers">Out of time... What a pitty, I'm really trying to stick to the suggested time frames ;-)</p>
