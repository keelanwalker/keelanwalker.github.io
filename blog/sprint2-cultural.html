                  <h2>My Learning Agreement</h2>
                  <p><em>14 November 2010</em></p>
                  
                  <p>As pointed out in my last blog, the result of my Myers Briggs personality test returned that I was a DEBATER PERSONALITY (ENTP, -A/-T).</p>
                  <p>I found it an interesting and astonishingly accurate assessment.  There are things about my personality that are identified in this analysis which I would love to reject, but, the reality is that they're quite true.</p>
                  <p>A very basic summary of my personality type is..</p>
                  <p><em>We are smart and curious thinkers who love solving new and challenging problems. We are bored by routine, outspoken and are relentless debaters.</em></p>
                  <p>I think there are a number of good attributes identified in the full summary of my personality assessment, which would not only make me a valuable team member, but also a good developer.  The tough part will be managing the attributes that would also make me a terrible team member.</p>
                  
                  <p>I have decided to identify the 3 main things that I will need to be mindful of in order to work well with the rest of my learning team</p>
                  <ul></ul>These are:</ul>
                  <li>limiting the urge to argue the insignificant details.</li>
                  <li>maintaining a respectful level of sensitivity about other peoples feelings.</li>
                  <li>Exercising tolerance</li>

                  <p>I chose these 3 things because to me, they appear to be the worst character attributes that are identified in the test. Therefore, it makes sense that I would address them first and foremost</p>
                  <ul>My plan to manage my workload, also based on my character attributes would be to utilise the following approaches:</ul>
                  <li>Remain focused on achieving short term, small, incremental goals.</li>
                  <li>Identifying the signs and signals of procrastination and avoiding it.</li>
                  <li>Getting enough, or a healthy amount of sleep. (Huge!)</li>
                  <p>I’m naturally inclined to try and solve most problems myself, however, the pitfall to this tactic is committing too much time to finding a solution which could result in missing deadlines. Therefore, to prevent this, my plan is to read the sprint overview at the beginning of each sprint and scheduling a study plan based on the suggested time frames.  As I work through each exercise, any confusing topics or areas can be temporarily sidelined and revisited at the end of the exercise.  If I am still having trouble solving the issue, then seek help, rather than leaving it to the end.</p>
                  <p>On the occasion that I may need help with a particular sprint, I would hope to expect a turn around in answer of less than half a day.  I believe half the battle of communicating an issue is describing or articulating my problem so it makes sense to the facilitator, in order to receive a clear answer.</p>
                  <P>During bootcamp, I will have no other known or planned commitments inside of regular study hours.  Going in to boot camp my commitments to studying is a minimum of 4 hours per day (2 hours in morning and 2 hours in the afternoon), 5 days a week.</p>
