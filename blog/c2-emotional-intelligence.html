                    <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
                    <p>By the end of the first chapter I had gained a basic understanding of what 'Emotional Intelligence' actually is, how it can be utilised to improve areas within your everyday life and how can train ourselves to learn this skillset through meditation.</p>

                    <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
                    <p>I found my mind wandering (or at least attempting to) a lot sooner than I had anticipated.  Two minutes doesn't seem like a long time but when you're trying to concentrate on just your breathing and nothing else, it seems longer.  I think I am going to need to practice this a lot more.</p>
