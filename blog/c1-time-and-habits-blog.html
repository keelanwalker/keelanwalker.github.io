   <h1>Time and habits</h1>
   
   <h2>Which Timebox and habits technique did you try?</h2>

  <p>
    I have only just read through the time and habit management resources and haven't actually used any of the techniques just yet.
    Of all of the techniques that I read through, I liked the 'Pomodoro Technique' the most because of it has a really clear, simple and practical process when it comes to implementing it into your work flow.  I have seen a similar system used in a productivity diary that was created by a well known Youtuber/internet entrepreneur named Alex Icon, where he also suggested cutting work into 25 minute blocks separated with 5 minute breaks.
    There are obviously several benefits to doing this, especially when planning projects and estimating the length of time involved in completing it.
  </p>
  <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>  
  <p>
    Some of the early articles about mindfulness and meditation techniques were very interesting.  This is not something I have practiced before or even experimented with.  Given the results of some of the research that has been completed around meditation and was presented in the articles I have decided to commit 2 mins of meditation prior to each study session for 1 week and doubling it each week after that until I reach 10 mins.
  </p>
   <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
  <p> 
   Unable to comment on this right now but, I'll come back to it once I have used both the Pomodoro technique and the meditation for 1 week.
  </p>
   <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
  <p>
   Unless I don't find any success in the above techniques I probably wouldn't experiment too much further with the other examples given in the time and habit resources.  If anything, I may scan through the other techniques to see if there's anything that may fit nicely into my chosen time and habit strategy.
