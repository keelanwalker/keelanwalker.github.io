                  <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
                  <p></p>
                  <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>  
                  <p>Before reading chapter 2, my thoughts about the topic were all based on my previous experiences exploring the concepts or practice of meditation. I have trialed similar methods in the past but never commited enough time to it in order to notice the benefits.</p>
                  <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
                  <p>In chapter 2 an example is given about a particular study which suggests there maybe a direct link between the increased antibody levels in a test subject who was vaccinated while meditating.  This is not something I would have expected could be achieved through meditation and I'd be interested in seeing if further stuies have been done.</p>
                  <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
                  <p>Not really, I think its about finding a comfortable position to support yourself so that it has the least affect on your meditation session.</p>
                  <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                  <p>Yeh, although I believe meditation could be a really beneficial tool for personal development, I'm not quite ready to concede that some of the supernatural claims in chapter 2 are as valid as the author claims. </p>
